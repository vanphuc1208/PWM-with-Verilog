# PWM with Verilog

## General Information:
- Goal: design, validate, and synthesize a PWM system.

## About the Project layout:
- PWM.v: implement the PWM.
- PWMTb.v: validate the operation of PWM using waveform.

## About the Operation:
***Input**
- clk: clock signal from the board.
- rst: reset the signal back to its initial state.

***Output**
dout: our output signal.

 ## Waveform:
